        question: "What is PickHacks?",
        answer: "PickHacks is Missouri S&T's annual hackathon â€” an innovation competition where students come together to bring a project to life over the course of a weekend. You come up with the idea, and we provide mentors, resources, and anything else you need. Programming experience isn't necessary; the only requirement is a willingness to learn and have fun! Plus, it's FREE!"
